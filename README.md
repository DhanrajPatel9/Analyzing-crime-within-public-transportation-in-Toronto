# Analyzing-crime-within-public-transportation-in-Toronto

The city of Toronto Prides itself on having one of the best public transportation systems in all of the world.
While riding on one of the cities numerous TTC buses one is able to reach every corner of the City and while
the city strives to keep their system running on a timely bases, there are situations which cause a delay.
Using the data provided by the city of Toronto we will be modeling and estimating information about the
delays that occur. Particularly, we will be estimating the rate of delays that occur in each day of the week
per 6 hour intervals.

Whenever an assault related case is reported to the TPS (Toronto Police service) the crime is investigated and
recorded in great detail. The recorded assault case is then further sub divided into the categories of: breaking
and entering, automotive theft and robbery so that more detail of what types of assaults are occurring in the
city can be investigated. In addition, the TPS also records which neighborhood the assault cases occur in to
gain a better understanding of which regions in Toronto are experiencing the most assault crimes. The TPS
gathers all the data and release the information annually and include all the data collected over the last 7
years. This data set contains the information collected from 2014 to 2020. Using this data, we can use linear
regression modeling to see analyze how the number of assault related crimes have been changing year by year.
